## Project Overview

This project consists of two real-world birthday invitation microsites: one for a 15th birthday and another for a 50th celebration. Both sites were designed and built from scratch to be elegant, fast, and memorable. Each site features a custom theme, background music player, countdown timer, and high mobile compatibility.

Instead of relying on frameworks, I built both using semantic HTML, custom CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, emphasizing accessibility, performance, and aesthetic polish.

### Live Sites
- 🎂 [Ana Lu's 15th Birthday](https://mis15analu.com)
- 🥂 [Sandra's 50th Birthday](https://los-50-de-sandra.nos-vemos-ahi.com)

## Key Features

- ⏳ **Live countdown timer** to the event
- 🎶 **Background music player** with autoplay and user control
- 🌐 **SEO and OG optimization** for link previews and search visibility
- ♿ **Accessibility first** — ARIA labels and semantic markup
- ⚡ **High Lighthouse scores** — 93+ performance, 100 accessibility
- 🖼️ **Media-optimized assets** using WebP, WebM, lazy loading
- 🧘 **Subtle animations** with Animate.css and custom CSS transitions
- 🚀 **Deployed on Netlify**, with fast load times and global CDN

## Development Highlights

- I focused on writing clean, framework-free code to demonstrate full control over performance and behavior.
- Emphasis on progressive enhancement: music player and countdown timer gracefully degrade if unsupported.
- Optimized each asset manually, from font loading strategy to image formats, for fast first contentful paint.

## Repositories

- [15th Birthday – Ana Lu](https://github.com/mstarrk/15lu)
- [50th Birthday – Sandra](https://github.com/mstarrk/50sandra)

## Notes

These sites were developed for real events and are fully live. While the code is public, assets and content are not licensed for commercial reuse. If you're interested in forking them for your own celebration, make sure to replace all content and media.
